            <h2>Dish Description</h2>
            <p>Golden layers of tender pasta embrace a rich, slow-simmered meat sauce infused with garlic, onions, and aromatic herbs. Velvety bÃ©chamel and creamy ricotta melt into every bite, blending perfectly with the tangy depth of marinara. Generous layers of bubbling mozzarella and sharp Parmesan form a golden, crispy crust on top, releasing an irresistible aroma as it bakes to perfection. Each forkful is a comforting harmony of savory, cheesy, and perfectly seasoned goodnessâ€”warm, hearty, and utterly satisfying. Whether fresh from the oven or as next-day leftovers, lasagna is the ultimate indulgence in classic Italian comfort food.</p>
